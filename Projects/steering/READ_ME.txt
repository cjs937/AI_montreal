In order to compile the project DeanLib needs to be in the folder outside of this one, as well as a directory
containing the allegro5 folder. After that everything should compile fine.

Inputs:
A - Adds dynamic arrive entity that moves towards the player
S - Adds a dynamic seek entity that seeks the player

Esc - Closes and exits the game
Mouse Click - Moves the player to the click
